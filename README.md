# StalinSort
"I came up with a single pass O(n) sort algorithm I call StalinSort. You iterate down the list of elements checking if they're in order. Any element that is out of order is eliminated. At the end you have a sorted list."
A few days ago I read this online and I felt the urgency to code it.
